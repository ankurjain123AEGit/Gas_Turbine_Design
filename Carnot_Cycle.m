% Carnot cycle 
% Q1 if Carnot cycle is the best possible cycle, why do we not use it as
% the model cycle for all the heat engines instead of bothering with
% several so-called ideal cycles?
% Ans) Most cycles encountered in practice differ significantly from the
% Carnot cycle, which makes it unsuitable as a realistic model.

% NOTE: Each ideal cycle discussed in this chapter is related to a specific workproducing
% device and is an IDEALIZED version of the actual cycle.
