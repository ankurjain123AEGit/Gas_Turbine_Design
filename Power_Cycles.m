% Important areas for thermodynamics: Power generation and refrigeration
% Thermodynamic_cycles --> Power cycles and refrigeration cycles
% Devices or systems which try to produce a net positive output power are
% called engines
% Thermodynamic cycles on which they operate = power cycles
% Devices or systems used to produce a refrigeration effect --> refrigerators, air conditioners, heat pumps
% Thermodynamic cycles on which they operate = refrigeration cycles
% Gas cycles --> Working fluid exists in gaseous phase during the entire
% cycle.
% Closed cycles --> working fluid is returned to the initial state after
% the cycle is completed.
% Open cycles --> working fluid is renewed at the end of each cycle instead
% of being recirculated.
% Ideal Cycle --> When an actual cycle is stripped of all the
% reversibilities and complexities in the system which causes every step in the process to
% be internally completely reversible, then the cycle is called an ideal cycle.

%% Air-Standard assumptions
% The actual gas power cycles are complex. To reduce the analysis to a
% manageable level, we utilize the following approximations, commonly known
% as the air-standard assumptions:
% 1.) The working fluid is air, which continuously circulates in a closed
% loop and always behaves as an ideal gas.
% 2.) All the processes that make up the cycle are internally reversible.
% 3.) The combustion process is replaced by a heat-addition process from an
% external source.
%

%% General idealizations and simplifications in the analysis of power cycles

% 1.) The cycle does not involve any friction. Therefore, the working fluid
% does not experience any pressure drop as it flows in pipes or devices
% such as heat exchangers.
% 2.) All expansion and contraction processes take place in a
% quasi-equilibrium manner.
% 3.) Pipes connecting the various components of a system are well
% insulated, and heat transfer through them is negligible.
% Neglecting the changes in kinetic and potential energies of the working
% fluid is another commonly utilized simplification in the analysis of
% power cycles.
% Only devices where kinetic energy changes are significant are nozzles and
% diffusers.

%% P-v and T-s diagrams

% Area under the P-v or T-s curves --> net work produced during the cycle =
% net heat transfer for that cycle.
% Efficiency under the Carnot cycle --> eta_th_carnot = 1 - T_L/T_H;
% Carnot cycle 4 steps --> 1.) Isothermal heat addition 
% 2.) Isentropic expansion 
% 3.) Isothermal heat rejection
% 4.) Isentropic compression
