% For general turbomachines, the stagnation enthalpy is more or less equal
% to the static enthalpy because of the low flow velocities
% Stagnation enthalpy is the enthalpy associated with the flow when it has
% been decelerated to '0' velocity and all the related kinetic energy has
% also been converted to static enthalpy.
% Total power that exits the gas turbine = shaft power (usable power) + hot air/fuel mixture 
% (unusable power)
% P_3 = power lost as hot air/fuel mixture 
% P_3 = (W_air + W_fuel)*cp_out*(T_out - T_ref)
% P_2 = 
% P_1 = 
% Mass of the airflow*heating value of the fuel*burner efficiency = 
% m_dot_f*b_int_cp_dt(T_in,T_final,w)*eta_burner =   
% Power of the cold air = massflow of the air*enthalpy of the cold air*

% P_shaft_ideal = P_1 + P_2 - P-3; 
% P_shaft = eta_M*(P_shaft_ideal); 

% eta_M = P_shaft_ideal/P_shaft_real % efficiency of the gas turbine system
